# Biotechnology graduate & bioinformatics enthusiast

## Summary

I am a Biotechnology graduate with a keen interest in omics and computational algorithms applicable to biological data. My skills in large-scale omics data analysis, visualization, and quality control (QC) metrics have enabled me to deliver impactful results, including contributions to a congress communication and a scientific poster during my previous internship. With training and experience in Python, R, and data visualization tools, I am eager to automate workflows, ensuring data reliability, and driving scientific discoveries.

I am currently pursuing a Master’s Degree in Bioinformatics to further deepen my expertise in the field. I consider myself a responsible and organized individual with the ability to work effectively both collaboratively and independently.

## 🔬 Research Experience
**Research Intern — Transcriptomic Analysis of Schwann Cells**  
[Gene Regulatory Control in Disease Lab](https://cimus.usc.gal/group/genecontrol) — CiMUS (USC, Spain)  
*Oct 2023 – Jul 2024*

- Conducted transcriptomic analysis of Schwann cells in diabetic neuropathy using R. Identified key regulatory pathways and linked findings to biological insights.
- Executed pipelines for quality control (QC), statistical analysis, and data visualization using tools such as FastQC, RMarkdown, and ggplot2.
- Ensured reproducibility and reliability in data analysis with proper documentation to maintain consistent and reliable data across research projects.
- Utilized **high-performance computing** (HPC) resources from [CESGA](https://www.cesga.es/en/home-2/). Managed computational workflows efficiently with the Slurm workload manager in a Unix-like environment.
- Delivered impactful results that contributed to my bachelor’s dissertation, a congress presentation, and two scientific posters, showcasing the significance of my work.
