# Biotechnology graduate & bioinformatics enthusiast

## Summary

I am a Biotechnology graduate with a keen interest in omics and computational algorithms applicable to biological data. My skills in large-scale omics data analysis, visualization, and quality control (QC) metrics have enabled me to deliver impactful results, including contributions to a congress presentation and a scientific poster during my previous internship. With training and experience in Python, R, and data visualization tools, I am eager to automate workflows, ensuring data reliability, and driving scientific discoveries.

I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s Degree in Bioinformatics to further deepen my expertise in computational biology. I consider myself a responsible and organized individual, with a strong team-oriented focus and the ability to work effectively both collaboratively and independently.
