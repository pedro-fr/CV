## Summary

I am a Biotechnology graduate with a keen interest in omics and computational algorithms applicable to biological data. My skills in large-scale omics data analysis, visualization, and quality control (QC) metrics have enabled me to deliver impactful results, including contributions to a congress presentation and a scientific poster during my previous internship. With training and experience in Python, R, and data visualization tools, I am eager to automate workflows, ensuring data reliability, and driving scientific discoveries.

I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s Degree in Bioinformatics to further deepen my expertise in computational biology. I consider myself a responsible and organized individual, with a strong team-oriented focus and the ability to work effectively both collaboratively and independently.

## ðŸ”¬ Research Experience
**Research Intern â€” Transcriptomic Analysis of Schwann Cells**  
Gene Regulatory Control in Disease Lab â€” CiMUS (USC, Spain)  
*Oct 2023 â€“ Jul 2024*

- Conducted large-scale transcriptomic analysis of Schwann cells in diabetic neuropathy using R, identifying key regulatory pathways and linking findings to biological insights.
- Developed pipelines for quality control (QC), statistical analysis, and data visualization using tools such as FastQC, RMarkdown, and ggplot2.
- Processed and integrated large-scale omics datasets (public and proprietary), ensuring reproducibility and reliability in data analysis with proper documentation to maintain consistent and reliable data across research projects.
- Utilized high-performance computing (HPC) resources, managing computational workflows efficiently with the Slurm workload manager in a Unix-like environment.
- Delivered impactful results that contributed not only to my bachelorâ€™s dissertation but also to both a congress presentation and a scientific poster, showcasing the significance of my work.
